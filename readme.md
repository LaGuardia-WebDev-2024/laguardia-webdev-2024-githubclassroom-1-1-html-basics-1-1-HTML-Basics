## Directions 
### Step #1 - Title your poem <br>
To practice the basics of HTML, let's have you write and markup a poem. To start off with, what will the title of your poem* be?
<br><br>
Using the `<h1>` tag we learned about, add a heading for your poem. This will be your title.

<i>*If you do not want to write a poem, feel free to use music lyrics to a song instead</i>
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Write your poem <br>
Now, below your heading, write the poem inside a paragraph tag. Your amazing poem should be multiple lines long, so you'll need to use a tag to make line breaks, too.
<br><br>
Remember that your `<p>` and `<br>` tags should be between the `<body>` and `</body>` tags.
